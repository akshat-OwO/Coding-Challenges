// Vanilla JavaScript DOM Challenges //


// BEGINNER CHALLENGES //

// 1. Create a div (donâ€™t put it in the DOM yet).
const div = document.createElement('div');

// 2. Add a class of "boxy" to that div.
div.classList.add('boxy');

// 3. Add two paragraphs of text to that div with the text of your choosing.
div.innerHTML = '<p>First para</p><p>Second Para</p>';

// 4. Insert the div into the DOM just after the h1.
const h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
h1.insertAdjacentElement('afterend', div);

// 5. Add a third paragraph to the div after itâ€™s in the DOM.
div.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', '<p>Third para</p>');



// BEGINNER+ CHALLENGES //

// 1. Add an unordered sublist to the last list item with three children ("one", "two", and "three").

// 2. Add a paragraph after the list of items with a class of "glow."

// 3. Remove a card when its button is clicked.

// 4. Change the event listener to the following Toggle the class "glow" to the image when you click the cardâ€™s button.

// 5. Change the event listener to the following. Change the title of all other cards to "Jealous ðŸ‘€" when you click on a cardâ€™s button. (BONUS: Change the title of the card that was clicked to "Iâ€™m the greatest!")


//INTERMEDIATE CHALLENGES//

// 1. Append a button below the card-container that says "Add more cards" (it should have the class "btn").

// 2. Create a function that generates a new card when clicked (you can copy current HTML code) and places it as the last card in the card container (BONUS: Set the query parameter of the image and the id of the image to its card number).

// 3. Create a function that adds cards but receives two parameters: title and description. When invoked, the function should create a new card with those parameters as the title (the h2 text) and description (the paragraph text) of the card. Create 3 new cards from the JavaScript file (i.e., upon page load)

// 4. Removes a card from the DOM only when a card image is clicked. (BONUS: Make it work on new cards added to the DOM.)

// 5. Create and insert a button that says "Change Color Scheme" (ensure the button has a class of 'btn') that changes the css variable --_hue to a random number between 0 and 360 when clicked.
